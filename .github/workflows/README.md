# Component sync workflow

This workflow synchronizes components from the main [untitleduico/react](https://github.com/untitleduico/react) repository with intelligent commit tracking.

## How to use

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select "Sync Components from Main Repository"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure options:
   - **Directories**: Which directories to sync (default: `components,hooks,utils,styles`)
   - **Sync mode**: Choose between `all` or `existing-only`
5. Click "Run workflow" to start the sync

## What it does

1. **Fetches** the latest commit information from the main repository
2. **Tracks** previously synced commits to show what's new
3. **Creates** a branch named `sync/YYYY-MM-DD-[commit-hash]`
4. **Processes** files by removing `"use client";` directives
5. **Generates** a PR with commit history and detailed diff summaries
6. **Stores** the sync state for future runs

## Sync modes

### `all` (default)
- Syncs all files from the main repository
- Adds new files and updates existing ones
- Creates complete mirror of main repo structure

### `existing-only`
- Only updates files that already exist in your repository
- Skips new files from the main repository
- Useful for maintaining a subset of components

## Smart commit tracking

- **First run**: Shows "Initial sync" with latest commit details
- **Subsequent runs**: Shows commit range since last sync
- **Up-to-date**: Indicates when no new commits are available
- **Commit history**: Collapsible list of all commits since last sync

## Branch naming

Branches follow the pattern: `sync/YYYY-MM-DD-[short-commit-hash]`
- Example: `sync/2024-03-15-a1b2c3d`

## PR format

The generated PR includes:

### Title
- **New commits**: `ðŸ”„ Sync components (X commits) â†’ a1b2c3d`
- **First sync**: `ðŸŽ‰ Initial sync from main repository â†’ a1b2c3d`

### Content
- **Commits since last sync**: Collapsible commit history with links
- **Changed files**: Each file with collapsible diff view
- **Sync details**: Source repo, latest commit, date, directories synced
- **Automated processing**: Notes about `"use client"` removal

## State management

The workflow stores sync state in `.github/last-sync-commit` to track:
- Last successfully synced commit hash
- Enables incremental sync reporting
- Shows commit ranges in PR descriptions

## Requirements

- Repository must have `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions
- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically available in GitHub Actions)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR creation
